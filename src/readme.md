PDF to Markdown Converter
A full-stack application that converts PDF files into clean, structured Markdown text. The backend is built with Python (Flask), handling PDF uploads and conversion, while the frontend uses React.js for a minimal and intuitive user experience.

Features
Upload PDF: Supports uploading PDF files via the web interface.

Automatic Conversion: Converts uploaded PDFs to Markdown, preserving structure and formatting.

Download Result: Get the output as a Markdown (.md) file.

Minimal Design: Clean UI with solid colors for focus and usability.

API-first: RESTful backend with CORS support for modern clients.

Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js (Minimal, solid color scheme)

Backend: Python (Flask, pdfplumber/PyMuPDF/pdfminer for PDF extraction)

CORS: Enabled for local and production use

Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/pdf-to-markdown-converter.git
cd pdf-to-markdown-converter
2. Backend Setup
bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Example requirements.txt:
# Flask
# flask_cors
# pdfplumber
# markdownify
Run the server:

bash
python app.py
3. Frontend Setup
bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm start
Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

Usage
Upload a PDF by clicking the upload area or drag & dropping your file.

Click Convert to process the PDF.

Once done, click Download Markdown to save the result.

API Endpoint
POST /upload — Expects multipart/form-data with a file field (the PDF).

Returns the converted Markdown.

Sample cURL:

bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@/path/to/file.pdf" http://localhost:5000/upload --output output.md
Troubleshooting
React fetch/upload fails: Ensure you do not set the Content-Type header manually when sending FormData; the browser manages this automatically.

CORS errors: Confirm flask_cors is imported and CORS(app) is called in app.py.

Large PDFs: Test with smaller files first. Adjust max_content_length in Flask configuration if needed.

API errors: Check Flask console for tracebacks after a failed upload.
